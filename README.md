<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Get started with MoonHare.CSS, Framework for building responsive, mobile-first sites, with jsDelivr and a template starter page.
Looking to quickly add MoonHare.CSS to your project? Use jsDelivr, a free open source CDN. Using a package manager or need to download the source files? [Head to the releases page](https://github.com/beautifycss/Beautify/releases).

### Installation
Copy-paste the stylesheet  `<link>`  into your  `<head>`  before all other stylesheets to load our CSS.

```html
<link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MoonHareLabs/MoonHare.CSS/dist/css/beautify.min.css" rel="stylesheet" crossorigin="anonymous">
```
```diff
! Warning: Don't use CDN for testing purposes.
! Because It returns cached files.
```

### Starter template

Be sure to have your pages set up with the latest design and development standards. That means using an HTML5 doctype and including a viewport meta tag for proper responsive behaviors. Put it all together and your pages should look like this:

Copy

```html
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <!-- Required meta tags -->
    <meta charset="utf-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

    <!-- Beautify.CSS -->
    <link href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/MoonHareLabs/MoonHare.CSS/dist/css/beautify.min.css" rel="stylesheet" crossorigin="anonymous">

    <title>Hello, world!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
  </body>
</html>

```

That’s all you need for overall page requirements.
